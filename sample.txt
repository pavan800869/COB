Albert Einstein was a renowned theoretical physicist known for his theory of relativity. He was born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, and his work had a profound impact on the field of physics. Einstein's equation, E=mc^2, is perhaps one of the most famous equations in the world. It relates energy (E) to mass (m) and the speed of light (c). His groundbreaking theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and the universe
